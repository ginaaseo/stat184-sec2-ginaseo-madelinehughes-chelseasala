#Does Spotify's mood-based playlists effectively align with their intended emotional themes as measured by audio features and user sentiment? 

##Overview
In this project we want to explore the effectiveness of Spotify's ability to curate user specific playlists based on their intended mood. 

##Progress 
In this project, we will analyze imported datasets from Spotify's API based on their user specific curated playlists. We will also extract audio features for each track and compare Spotify's playlists to look for consistancy and correlation between the theme and features. One tool that we will use is Spotify's GetBrowseCategories to collect the themes along with using GetPlaylistItems to sample data to a managable number. We will collect summary statistics, scatter plots, boxplots, models, histograms, QQ plots, and residual plots.
