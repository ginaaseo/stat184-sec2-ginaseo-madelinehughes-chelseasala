# Do film releases from 1978 to 2000 have a better IMDB rating on average compared to releases from 2000 to 2022? 

## Overview
In this project we want to explore whether or not film releases 22 years prior to the 21st century have a better average rating on IMDB compared to post 21st century. 

## Progress 
In this investigation, we will analyze the imported datasets from Kaggle CSV files looking at whether or not certain genres popularity, budget, or other factors influence ratings on films within IMDB from the timelines 1978-2000 vs. 2000-2022. 

## Introduction 
Cinema is a powerful reflection of cultural shifts, technological advancements, and audience expectations. Elements such as film ratings, budgets, and genres offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of audience preferences and the perceived quality of cinema. With the rapid evolution of filmmaking techniques—from practical effects to digital advancements—and shifting societal behaviors, it is important to examine whether older films have sustained their legacy of viewer appreciation when compared to contemporary releases.

This study focuses on exploring how the evolution of film production and audience reviewing behaviors has influenced reception, as measured by IMDB ratings. Specifically, we aim to investigate whether the average IMDB ratings of films have changed between two distinct periods: 1978 to 2000 and 2000 to 2022. By analyzing these time frames, we seek to uncover meaningful trends in film ratings, while considering the role of genre and budget in shaping audience perceptions. The findings from this analysis will provide deeper insights into the impact of filmmaking changes on audience engagement and the factors that contribute to enduring cinematic success.
