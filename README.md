# Do film releases from 1978 to the 2000s have a better IMDB rating on average compared to releases from the 2000s to 2022? 

## Overview
In this project we want to explore whether or not film releases 22 years prior to the 21st century have a better average rating on IMDB compared to post 21st century. 

## Progress 
In this investigation, we will analyze the imported datasets from Spotify's API based on their user specific curated playlists. We will also extract audio features for each track and compare Spotify's playlists to look for consistancy and correlation between the theme and features. One tool that we will use is Spotify's GetBrowseCategories to collect the themes along with using GetPlaylistItems to sample data to a managable number. We will collect summary statistics, scatter plots, boxplots, models, histograms, QQ plots, and residual plots.
